                    <h3>CS50 for Lawyers</h3>
                    <p>This course is a variant of Harvard University's introduction to computer science, CS50, designed
                        especially for lawyers (and law students). Whereas CS50 itself takes a bottom-up approach,
                        emphasizing mastery of low-level concepts and implementation details thereof, this course takes
                        a top-down approach, emphasizing mastery of high-level concepts and design decisions related
                        thereto. Ultimately, it equips students with a deeper understanding of the legal implications of
                        technological decisions made by clients.

                        Through a mix of technical instruction and discussion of case studies, this course empowers
                        students to be informed contributors to technology-driven conversations. In addition, it
                        prepares students to formulate technology-informed legal arguments and opinions. Along the way,
                        it equips students with hands-on experience with Python and SQL, languages via which they can
                        mine data for answers themselves.</p>

                    <h3>CS50's Introduction to Game Development</h3>
                    <p>In a quest to understand how video games themselves are implemented, you'll explore the design of
                        such childhood games as: Super Mario Bros., Pong, Flappy Bird, Breakout, Match 3, Legend of
                        Zelda, Angry Birds, Pokémon, 3D Helicopter Game, Dreadhalls, and Portal.

                        Via lectures and hands-on projects, the course explores principles of 2D and 3D graphics,
                        animation, sound, and collision detection using frameworks like Unity and LÖVE 2D, as well as
                        languages like Lua and C#. By class’s end, you'll have programmed several of your own games and
                        gained a thorough understanding of the basics of game design and development.</p>

                    <h3>PredictionX: John Snow and the Cholera Epidemic of 1854</h3>
                    <p> In 1854, a cholera epidemic swept through the London neighborhood of Soho. In about three weeks,
                        over 600 people died. This incident was, tragically, not unusual in London or the rest of the
                        19th-century world as a whole. The scourge of cholera seemed unstoppable and, even worse,
                        unpredictable. But one doctor — ignored by the scientific community at large — set out to prove
                        that he knew how cholera was spread.

                        Join us for this one-week, immersive learning experience where we explore John Snow’s London,
                        from the streets of Soho to the dataset that helped create the map that changed our
                        understanding of cholera and epidemiology forever.

                        This course features interactive tools including an interactive ArcGIS map of the 1854 cholera
                        outbreak and a Timeline JS of John Snow’s investigation. This module is a part of PredictionX,
                        which looks at the history of attempts to predict the future. PredictionX courses will cover
                        topics from omens and oracles in ancient civilizations to modern computer simulations.</p>
